true work input gives better output
limit slide key idea
people truly listen reading slide
keep slides simple idea per slide
good reminder people read listen time
interesting
basically put everything powerpoint read audience
important points video presentation must like story structured start middle end less flow one point next one idea per slide notes powerpoint slide
shows importance conveying message information across clearly key ideas
adding notes computer good idea would available us
overload boring information
less make slides simple
notes view show say talk
audience able listen read slide time useful necessary brief important information slides emphasising important points talk
powerpoint used visual aid repetition said verbally
crazy many presentations seen whole much information slide ineffective first method definitely set apart good presentations good ones
